**Goal: To solve the lab, perform an SQL injection attack that logs in to the application as the `administrator` user.**

(1) Determine that the application is vulnerable to sql. You can do this by injecting a ' in the login fields.

As a response, you will very likely get a DB error indicating that it is vulnerable to sql injection.

According to the Lab description, we need to bypass login for the user "administrator"

All we would have to do to solve this is modify the username parameter, giving it the value: `administrator'--`

The -- mark will avoid all other following characters in the SQL Query and login to the administrator account successfully
