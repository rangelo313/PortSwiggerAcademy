Goal: You have obtained a valid username and password but you do not have access to the user's 2FA Verification code. To solve this lab access Carlos's account page.

(1) I first started off by successfully logging into the account provided.

As a result- it asked me to enter my 4 digit security code. I saw at thetop  there was an email client that gave me a security code and email address associated with it. I tried to use the security code with the account and observed that after successfully entering it in- you are redirected to the /my-account page.

As a result, I simply changed the header to /my-account when prompted for a mfa code and found it to be successful.
