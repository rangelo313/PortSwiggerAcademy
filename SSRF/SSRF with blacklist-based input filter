This lab has a stock check feature which fetches data from an internal system.

To solve the lab, change the stock check URL to access the admin interface at http://localhost/admin and delete the user carlos.

The developer has deployed two weak anti-SSRF defenses that you will need to bypass.


localhost :: http://127.1/
-URL decoding one time
--regex search using a blacklist of strings is a very interesting approach here.

when we encoded it twice it worked because it just decodes it once
To delete we just append this to solve the lab to delete the user:
/admin/delete?username=carlos
