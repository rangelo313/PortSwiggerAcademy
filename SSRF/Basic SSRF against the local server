# Basic SSRF against the local server

## Goal: To solve the lab, change the stock check URL to access the admin interface at http://localhost/admin and delete the user carlos.

Browse to /admin and observe that you can't directly access the admin page.
Visit a product, click "Check stock", intercept the request in Burp Suite, and send it to Burp Repeater.
Change the URL in the stockApi parameter to http://localhost/admin. This should display the administration interface.
Read the HTML to identify the URL to delete the target user, which is:

http://localhost/admin/delete?username=carlos
I submitted this in the request and solved.
