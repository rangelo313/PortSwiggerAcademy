This lab has an unprotected admin panel. It's located at an unpredictable location, but the location is disclosed somewhere in the application.

Solve the lab by accessing the admin panel, and using it to delete the user carlos.

I went to chrome developer tools under the /login subdirectory and found in the javascript /admin-em2xfg
